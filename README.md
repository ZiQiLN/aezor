# SquaredAvenue

SquaredAvenue is an small experiment made up by Jakub Olan, to check what we can archive by building Minecraft server (as application which needs a lot of
resources) on Kubernetes and what problems may come when it comes to scalability. SquaredAvenue is an pretty big adventure mixed with technology modpack which
should probivde few good hours to spend time with.
