# docker-minecraft

Having some with building a Minecraft Forge server to play some minecraft with usage of Docker. I have no idea why I'm building this lol

## Introduction

Running a `docker-compose.yml` will start a minecraft server and include mods from `mods` folder in directory with `docker-compose.yml`.
